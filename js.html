    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that makes web pages dynamic and interactive. It runs directly in the browser, handling tasks like form validation, content updates, and animations. JavaScript works closely with HTML and CSS. It supports many libraries and frameworks like React and Angular. It's essential for building modern, responsive websites.
