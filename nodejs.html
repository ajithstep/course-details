    <h1>NODEJS</h1>
    <img src="./NODEJS.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs on the server, and it's commonly used with the Express.js framework for backend development. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it efficient for real-time applications like chat apps and live updates. Node.js allows full-stack development using only JavaScript. Express provides tools for routing, middleware, and API development. It's lightweight and fast, ideal for building RESTful APIs.</p>
